# Auto Fullscreen

This is a dumb 15 lines [plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/i-auto-fullscreen/) 
that makes Firefox open all windows in fullscreen mode. 
On startup it simply updates the current window to set the window state to fullscreen and adds 
a listener to update subsequent new windows.

This add-on is a fork. The original version can be found 
[here](https://github.com/tazeat/AutoFullscreen).

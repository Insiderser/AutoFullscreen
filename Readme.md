# Auto Fullscreen

This is a dumb 15 lines [plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/i-auto-fullscreen/) 
that makes Firefox open all windows in fullscreen mode. 
On startup it simply updates the current window to set the window state to fullscreen and adds 
a listener to update subsequent new windows.

Credits go to [tazeat](https://github.com/tazeat/). His [add-on](https://github.com/tazeat/AutoFullscreen)
turns fullscreen mode on only on startup, though he
[proposed a solution](https://github.com/tazeat/AutoFullscreen/issues/4) that makes it
work with all windows (even after startup). This plugin is just a fork with that solution
(though there aren't any "forked from" flags).
